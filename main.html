	 <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial aspect of algorithm analysis that helps in determining the efficiency of an algorithm. It provides an estimate of the time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. An efficient algorithm is one that has a lower time complexity, meaning it requires less time to execute for larger inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. It is expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates how the space requirements grow with the input size. Understanding Space Complexity is essential for developing algorithms that are not only fast but also memory-efficient.</p>

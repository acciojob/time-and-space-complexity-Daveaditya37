	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that
		describes the time required to execute an algorithm efficient way. The 
		time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it
		takes for each statement to complete.</p>
	
	<p>The term <strong>Space Complexity</strong> is misused for Auxiliary Space at many places. Following are the correct definitions of Auxiliary Space and <strong>Space Complexity</strong>. 

Auxiliary Space is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm.

The <strong>space Complexity</strong> of an algorithm is the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. <strong>Space complexity</strong> includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. 

For example, if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space, then Auxiliary Space would be a better criterion than <strong>Space Complexity</strong>. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space, Insertion sort, and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. The <strong>space complexity</strong> of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though. 

<strong>Space complexity</strong> is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.</p>
